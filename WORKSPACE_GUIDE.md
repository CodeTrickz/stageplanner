# Workspace and Team Guide

## What are Workspaces?

A workspace is a group where you collaborate with others on planning, notes, and files. Each user automatically has a personal workspace.

## How to use Workspaces

### 1. Workspace selector in Top Bar / Sidebar

After logging in you will see a **Workspace selector**:
- On desktop in the top bar
- On mobile/tablet in the sidebar
- Also in **Settings** under “Group”

It shows:
- The name of your current workspace
- Your role (Owner, Editor, Commenter, or Viewer)

Click the workspace selector to switch between workspaces.

### 2. Team page

Go to the **Team** page in the menu to:
- View all team members
- Invite new members (if you are an Owner)
- Update roles (if you are an Owner)
- Remove members (if you are an Owner)

### 3. Inviting members

If you are an **Owner** in a workspace:
1. Go to the **Team** page
2. Click **Invite**
3. Enter the email address of the person you want to invite
4. Choose the role: **Editor**, **Commenter**, or **Viewer**
5. Click **Invite**

The invited person receives an email with a link to accept the invitation.

### 4. Roles and permissions

**OWNER:**
- ✅ Full access to workspace data
- ✅ Can manage members and roles

**EDITOR:**
- ✅ Can create/edit/delete planning items, notes, and files
- ❌ Cannot manage members

**COMMENTER:**
- ✅ Can view planning items, notes, and files
- ✅ Can add feedback/comments
- ❌ Cannot create or delete items

**VIEWER:**
- ✅ Read-only access to workspace data
- ❌ Cannot comment or edit

### 5. Planning and notes

When you select a workspace:
- All planning items are filtered to the selected workspace
- All notes are filtered to the selected workspace
- New items you create are automatically linked to the current workspace

## Troubleshooting

### I don't see the workspace selector

1. Check that you are logged in
2. Refresh the page (F5)
3. Look in the top bar or in **Settings → Group**
4. Check the browser console for errors (F12)

### I see "No workspaces"

This means you do not have a workspace yet. Every user should automatically have a personal workspace. If not:
1. Log out and log in again
2. If the problem remains, contact an administrator

### I can't see team members

1. Ensure you selected a workspace
2. Go to the **Team** page
3. If you are an Owner, you should see all members

### I can't invite members

Only **Owner** roles can invite members. Check your role in the workspace selector.
